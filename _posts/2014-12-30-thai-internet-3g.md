### Why this page?

Internet in Thaiand is all like shit. When we booked our apartment, it was like WiFi access included.
When we arrived, it was like WiFi will be included for 650 Bt per device (1 Euro apx. 40 Bt). 
First I thought ok, i'll setup access point n my cell phone. Next thing i realized, it's not possible 
to use WiFi in my phon for both connect internet and spread it over other devices.

### My solution

So, i need another way. And the only way is 3G. Well, I go to 'Seven Eleven' and buy one-2-call AIS 
SIM card with 3G for 50 bt. Later i realize only 15 of them are credited to my acceount. Next thing
I realize (when viewing one2call website in thai - that was hard) - i only can apply "unlimited" internet with
limit of 1G ( want to see movie? No fucking way! )

Later I found out there is another type of one-2-call SIM cards ( those with large "3G" in the center, 
not a small logo in top right corner). For those SIM cards it is possable to have unlimited "slow" 
internet at 384kb/s for 69 Bt per week.

This SIM cards I was only able to find at AIS offices. So I just addressed a personal, said "I want
3G internet for 69 baht per week", and they took my passport, my money, my phone and in half an hour
all was done.

Every week i receive SMS "Your weekly internet gonna die. Press \*777\*723# and dial to continue". 
Today i tried and got an error message "Try again blah blah blah". I tried. Then i tired. The real 
combination was \*777\*731# and dial.

To check balance in one-2call AIS use \*121# and dial.
  
To credit an account I go into seven elleven. They decline to put 80 baht, only 100. So i suffer, but 
not to much. I give 100 Bt to seller, say "Put in one-2-call", they give me a paper wirh 16-digit code.
I take my phone, press \*120\*<16-digit-code># and dial. If everything is fine, i got SMS aith my payment
confirmition.
