# Why

OS X is a piece of shit. I can tell thet after one year of using it on both Mac Mini and MacBooc air.

# What

I want to keep original OS X installation. Just in case i need to test on it or use
xcode or some other kind of silly things. I want CentOS 7 with some lightweight 
desktop manager (fuck GNOME 3) and i want to give a try to Fedora 22 (still fuck GNOME 3).
I will give about 30Gb to every linux distro and share the rest space between them as my 
home directory.

# How

My plan is:

  * Install [rEFInd](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/) boot manager
  * Resize OS X HFS partition 
  * Install Fedora 22 and/or CentoOS 7
  * Build linux drivers for fucking broadcom WiFi used in Mac Mini based on elrepo instructions

# Log

First of all i place my mac mini where i have a wire, so i will have internet access after 
installing Fedora ( booting with live CD proved there is no WiFi driver for Broadcom in Fedora) 

## Install rEFInd
rEFInd is a successor of rEFIt project since the last on is not mainained anymore. 

I download rEFInd as a binary zip archive at http://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/files/0.9.0/refind-bin-0.9.0.zip/download.
[This page](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/getting.html) links to sourceforge download page.

Command to ensure i have 64 bit arch on my OS X

    ioreg -l -p IODeviceTree | grep firmware-abi

Next, i mount my esp as described ar rEFInd "Manual OS X install" page

    mkdir /Volumes/esp
    mount -t msdos /dev/disk0s1 /Volumes/esp

I unpack  downloaded zip archive with funder (unzip, however, should do the job as well)
Change into unpacked directory and just run install.sh

    sh install.sh

I have some outut stating thet all went good. I reboot and a see boot loader screen with
OS X as the only option. 

## Resize partition

Go to launchpad, then Utilities and choose 'Disk utility'. In the opened window i see my 500Gb 
Toshiba drive and single disklabel (?) within. I click the disk and have some tabs in a main 
area. There is Disc Partition (i believe, through i have russian "Разделы диска"). Anyway, it
is the central tab of five, and there a can change partition size by dragging its picture with
the mouse, or enter desired size. After that a click Apply and after some warning word OS X
resizes partition. Well, i had to click the partition to select it in partition scheme before
resize button became active.

Now it's done and i have to install Fedora LXDE spin onto my mac mini. I have downloaded 
iso image yesterday and put it on a USB stick with dd command under my CentOS 6. I failed 
to do that on Mac Mini, but i believe that is possible.
